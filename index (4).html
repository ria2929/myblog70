      <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">I HAD VISITED IN OCTOBER 2018</h5>
      
      <p class="text muted">QUAINT LITTLE RESTAURANT TUCKED INSIDE A BY-LANE OF JUHU. BLINK AND YOU
        WITH MISS THE ENTRANCE TO THE CAFE. SO TO BE ALERT ENOUGH TO SPOT THE BLACK SIGNBOARD THAT SAYS
        "PRITHVI CAFE" WHILE YOU ARE IN THE MAIN ROAD. THE RESTAURANT HAS A REASONABLY GOOD MENU AT
        REASONABLE PRICES. THE FOOD IS DELICIOUS, THE SERVINGS ARE QUITE LARGE AND SOME SISHES CAN BE 
        SHARED BY 2 PEOPLE. ATTRACTS QUITE A TRENDY CROUD OF ASPIRING CELEBRITIES ON SHOW DAYS. BE SURE
        TO BOOK IN ADVANCE TO AVOID DISAPPOINTMENTS. ON OTHER DAYS, THE CROWD IS PRETTY HEP AND HAPPENING.
        HOSTS ARE FAMOUS "PRITHVI THEATER FEST", WHICH YOU MUST ATTEND IF POSSIBLE. </p>

    <p>I WATCHED IT WHEN I WAS 4 AND I LOVED IT. THIS IS THE FIRST MOVIE OF FROZEN 
      AND YOU WILL A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE MOVIE AT THE END. THERE IS LOTS OF SUSPENSE AS WELL AS HUMOR.
      MY FAVOURITE CHARACTER WAS OLAF AND HOW ELSA MAD HIM. THE STORY IS MOSTLY ABOOUT HOW ELSA AND ANNA ARE SISTERS
      AND WHEN THEY WERE YOUND THE SEPARATED. THEY MET ONCE AGAIN BUT DIDN'T RE-UNITE, NOW ANNA WILL DO ALL HER BEST TO BE WITH
      HER SISTER WITH THE HELP OF HER FRIENDS. YOU WILL MOST CERTAINLY ENJOY THE JOURNEY OF ANNA TRYING TO RE-UNITE WITH ANNA.
      THE MOVIE IS BASED ON HOW MAGIC SEPERATED THE SISTERS AND HOW MAGIC RE-UNITED THE SISTERS. THE MOVIE IS AN AVERAGE LENGTH OF 1 HOUR 
      AND 45 MINUTES, BUT IT IS ALL WORTH THE HIPE.
